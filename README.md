# Geometry
This is a simple Geometry project, to practise inheritance. 

In this project, we define a base class Point, which very simply allows a point on a Cartesian grid to be set. The Insertion operator is also overloaded to display the Point objects coordinates. A Circle class is then derived from this class, which contains methods for setting a radius, and subsequently calculating the circle area. The inserrtion operator is again overloaded to display circle parameters, using the inherited point constructor to display it's centre. Finally, a Cylinder class is derived from the Circle Class, again with radius/height getter & setter methods and an insertion operator overload. 

Again, this was more a practise project on my end, but why not share it.
